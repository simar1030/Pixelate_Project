This is the code that got us 3rd position in Pixelate-2k22, an image processing event.

Pixelate is an event under **TECHNEX**, the annual Techo-Management fest of IIT (BHU) Varanasi.


**Problem Statement**: Pixelate of Technex 2022, expected us to simulate a robot according to the given rules using the live feed from an overhead camera feed. The detailed problem statement of **Pixelate-2022** can be found here - [Problem Statement.pdf](https://github.com/AnantJain05/Pixelate-22/blob/main/Pixelate_PS.pdf)

This is a sample of the feed available from the overhead camera.
